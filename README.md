Bamazon.sql:

  In MySql I created a database called Bamazon.  I created a table that had colums with id, product name, department name, price, and stock quantity.  I inserted 10 different values in each column to start the table.



BamazonCustomer.js:

  The programs I installed was inquirer, mysql and console.table.  When the user types node bamazonCustomer.js into the terminal, a table with all of the products that I imported from Bamazon.sql will pop up.  This will prompt for the user to pick which item they would like to purchase.  When they pick an item, it will prompt them to input how many of the item they would like.  From there it will tell them that the purchase was successful and a purchase summary will show with the item name, the item count and the total of the purchase.
  
BamazonManager.js:

  The programs I installed was inquirer, mysql and console.table.  When the user types node bamazonManager.js into the terminal, they will be prompted to pick view products for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory, and add new product.  If they choose view products for sale, it will show the entire table and all the products for sale.  If they choose view low inventory, it will show only the products that have a stock quantity below 5.  If they choose add to inventory, it will add what you want to add and how much you would like to add.  It will tell the user that the stock was added successfully.  From there the user will put in node bamazonCustomer.js and it will show the updated stock.  The user can than go back to bamazonManager.js and choose add new product.  It will ask them what is the new ID, what is the product, what department, what is the price and how much product they would like to add.  When the user inputs all the information, it will prompt them that the add was successful.  The user will go back to bamazonCustomer.js and see that the table has been updated with the new product.
